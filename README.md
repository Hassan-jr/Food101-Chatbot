## FOOD101 CHATBOT
I've combined the power of Dialogflow, TensorFlow, FastAPI, and Next.js to create a cutting-edge restaurant chatbot capable of seamlessly interpreting both textual and visual data (images). Leveraging a custom CNN model trained on 101K food items from the Food101 dataset, my chatbot revolutionizes the ordering experience by accurately analyzing uploaded images to predict food items. This integration not only enhances user interaction but also showcases my proficiency in machine learning, natural language processing, and web development. With a passion for pushing technological boundaries.
